					<P><EM><FONT face="TimesRoman">In recent years I spent considerable energy on a photographic 
								survey of those structures which remain in the Nazi concentration camps and 
								printing them in gumoil. This project involved three trips to Europe, six 
								countries, and many hours of cold weather walking through the ten camps in 
								which buildings have been preserved. Sixty finished pictures came from this 
								effort. Several will be exhibited at the Museum of the Holocaust in conjunction 
								with the City of Houston's Fotofest in March, 2004.</FONT></EM>
